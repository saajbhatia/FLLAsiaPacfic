# FLLAsiaPacfic# FLL2022 - Super Powered
#
# This repository was created by the FLL team - The TechnoWatts
# to learn how to use python to code the EV3 brick to perform
# various tasks designed for the FLL Robot challenge.
# Team members work on their assigned python files to complete 
# a mission or a supportive element of all mission (eg. navigation)
# One or two volunteers then work together to create their own
# python project and combine the code snippets together to run
# 2.5 minute match missions.
